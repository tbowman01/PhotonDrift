# Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Compliance

This ADR establishes the process for documenting architectural decisions. All significant architectural decisions should be documented using this format.

Use `adrscan propose` to automatically generate new ADRs when architectural drift is detected, or create them manually following this template.
