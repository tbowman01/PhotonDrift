## 📊 Priority Matrix

```
URGENT & IMPORTANT
├── Security actions from #47
└── High-priority dependency updates from #16

IMPORTANT (NOT URGENT)
├── WASM development (#10)
├── CI/CD pipeline (#27)
└── Performance improvements from #46

## 🔄 Automation Opportunities

1. **Auto-labeling**: Implement GitHub Actions to auto-label based on:
   - Title keywords (e.g., "[BUG]", "[PHASE X]", "Security")
   - File paths modified in PRs
   - Issue templates

2. **Auto-assignment**: Rules for automatic assignment:
   - Security issues → Security team
   - WASM issues → WASM specialist
   - CI/CD issues → DevOps team

3. **Priority scoring**: Factors to consider:
   - Security impact (highest weight)
   - User impact
   - Development blockers
   - Technical debt

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Apply recommended labels to all issues
2. Create sub-issues for high-priority items from reports
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated triage
4. Establish SLA for issue response times
5. Create issue templates for better classification
