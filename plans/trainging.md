## üóìÔ∏è Updated 1.5‚ÄëHour Session Structure

Each session now runs **90 minutes**, with time split between presentation and practical workshop. You can even shift to **60 min hands-on / 30 min slides** depending on the group's preference.

### 1. Governance & Compliance (90 min)

**Slides & Discussion (60 min)**

* Intro to ADR automation and governance
* AI oversight framework: mapping AI outputs to ADR policy
* Risk management practices from corporate AI governance ([arXiv][1])
* Group activity: draft/update ADR automation policy

**Hands‚Äëon (30 min)**

* Demo: trigger ADR drift alert in CI pipeline
* Lab: attach ADR enforcement to a mock AI‚Äëgenerated code merge

### 2. Developers (90 min)

**Slides & Discussion (60 min)**

* ADR structure, CI integration
* Tools: ADR Sync, LLMs for decision logging
* Best practices: embedding ADR prompts into Git workflows
* Show gaps in current ADR pipelines (e.g. missing drift tracking)

**Hands‚Äëon (30 min)**

* Live: commit change in sample repo ‚Üí generate ADR via LLM
* Simulate drift ‚Üí handle via ADR update or issue filing

### 3. Strategy & Leadership (90 min)

**Slides & Discussion (60 min)**

* Strategic value of ADR automation in AI environments
* Metrics: coverage, drift, compliance score, ROI
* Roadmap planning and change management best practices&#x20;
* Identify organizational enablers/barriers (e.g. decentralized teams)

**Hands‚Äëon (30 min)**

* Demo: dashboard walkthrough with ADR health metrics
* Leader exercise: define roll‚Äëout milestones and sponsor commitments

## üß© Gaps to Fill

| Gap Area                         | Recommendation                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training on AI ethics & bias** | Use frameworks like the ‚ÄúHourglass‚Äù model to embed ethics in AI governance ([arXiv][1], [arXiv][2]) |
| **Data governance workflows**    | Integrate ADRs with data management policies‚Äîtrace context, consent, handling                       |
| **Cross-functional alignment**   | Involve security, data privacy, compliance teams to avoid siloed decisions                          |
| **Ongoing education & clinics**  | Set regular ‚ÄòADR Clinics‚Äô for sync, updates, and continuous improvement                             |
| **Drift remediation escalation** | Define when drift alerts escalate, enforce SLAs, automate remediation                               |
| **Platform/tooling support**     | Provide CI/CD pipeline scripts, ADR Sync setup, LLM prompt templates                                |
| **Change management**            | Communicate shifts clearly‚Äîleadership messaging, policy updates, stakeholder buy-in                 |

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Slide deck outlines** for each session with key talking points.
2. Hands-on **demo scripts** for ADR drift and AI‚Äëassisted ADR generation.
3. **Templates & tooling**: ADR formats, CI jobs, AI prompt examples.
4. **Schedule follow-up clinics** and train wider teams (security, data, compliance).

Would you like me to draft the slide decks now, prepare demo scripts, or build out the activity templates? We can also detail the AI ethics & bias modules or data-governance integrations next! üòä
