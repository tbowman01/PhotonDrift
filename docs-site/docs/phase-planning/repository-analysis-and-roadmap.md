- **WASM Module**: 409KB functional binary (restored from 16-byte failure)
- **Dependencies**: Fully modernized with semantic versioning automation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with 25+ guides and specifications

### 🔧 Technical Infrastructure
- **Build System**: ✅ Release builds working (1m 22s compilation)
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Automated branch-based versioning system
- **Multi-Platform**: ✅ Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM64, WASM support
- **Security**: ✅ No critical vulnerabilities, dependency audit clean
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized builds with LTO and symbol stripping

## 🚀 Issue Triage Results

### ✅ Successfully Closed (4 Issues/PRs)
1. **Issue #45**: Paste dependency resolved (nalgebra v0.33 upgrade eliminated transitive dependency)

## 🎯 Phase 2.5 Completion Tasks

### 🚨 Critical Remaining Items

#### 1. Docker Binary Verification (Issue #87)
**Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKING PHASE 2.5 COMPLETION**
```yaml
# Required: Add to .github/workflows/container-build.yml
- name: Verify ADRScan Binary
  run: |
    # Check binary exists
    docker run --rm photondrift/adrscan:latest ls -la /usr/local/bin/adrscan
    
    # Test functionality
    docker run --rm photondrift/adrscan:latest adrscan --help
    
    # Verify expected output
    docker run --rm photondrift/adrscan:latest adrscan --version | grep "adrscan"
```

**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Must complete before Phase 3  
**Estimate**: 2 hours  
**Impact**: Completes containerization strategy

#### 2. Code Quality Improvements (Issue #51)
**Status**: ⚠️ **TECHNICAL DEBT**
```rust
// Areas requiring refactoring:
// - src/drift/scanner.rs (unused methods, 413 lines)
// - src/ml/models.rs (dead code warnings, 2000+ lines)  
// - src/commands/plugin.rs (unused imports/variables)
```

**Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Improve maintainability  
**Estimate**: 8 hours  
**Impact**: Reduces technical debt, improves security

### ✅ Phase 2.5 Achievements
- **Dependency Modernization**: ✅ 40+ packages updated, wasmtime v23→v35
- **Semantic Versioning**: ✅ Complete automation system implemented
- **WASM Restoration**: ✅ 16 bytes → 409KB functional module
- **Build Pipeline**: ✅ Multi-platform releases automated
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive guides and strategies

**Phase 2.5 Completion**: **95%** (Docker verification pending)
