# Containerization and Secure Multi-Platform Deployment Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With ADRScan showing maturity as a CLI tool, we need a standardized, secure, and portable deployment strategy that:

1. **Simplifies Distribution**: Package the application with all dependencies for consistent execution across environments
2. **Enhances Security**: Implement defense-in-depth security practices for production deployments
3. **Enables Cloud-Native Usage**: Support container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.)
4. **Multi-Platform Support**: Provide consistent experience across different CPU architectures
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate secure container builds and distribution

### Current Deployment Challenges

- **Dependency Management**: Users must have Rust toolchain and proper system dependencies
- **Platform Variations**: Different behavior across operating systems and architectures  
- **Security Concerns**: No standardized security hardening for production environments
- **Distribution Complexity**: Manual binary building and distribution processes
- **Integration Barriers**: Difficult to integrate into existing containerized infrastructures

### Drift Detection Analysis

Post-containerization analysis shows:
- **Files Scanned**: 203 (increased from 198)
- **Lines Analyzed**: 30,540 (increased from 30,005)
- **No Architectural Drift Detected**: Containerization treated as implementation detail
- **New Files Added**: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, container-build.yml workflow

## Decision

We will implement a **secure multi-stage containerization strategy** using Docker with the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Multi-Stage Build Architecture

**Build Stage (`rust:1.75-slim-bullseye`)**:
- Official Rust image for reliable builds
- Dependency layer caching for faster subsequent builds
- Security updates applied during build process
- Separate dependency compilation from source compilation

**Runtime Stage (`gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11:nonroot`)**:
- Distroless base image for minimal attack surface
- No shell, package managers, or unnecessary binaries
- Significantly reduced vulnerability exposure
- Smaller final image size

### 2. Security-First Design

**Non-Root Execution**:
- Container runs as user `65532:65532` (nonroot)
- No privilege escalation capabilities
- Follows principle of least privilege

**Hardened Container**:
- Distroless base eliminates common attack vectors
- Binary stripping for reduced size and information disclosure
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Comprehensive security scanning with Trivy

**Supply Chain Security**:
- Build provenance attestation
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Immutable base image references with SHA256 digests
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### 3. Multi-Platform Support

**Target Architectures**:
- `linux/amd64` - Standard x86_64 servers and workstations
- `linux/arm64` - ARM-based servers, Apple Silicon, edge devices

**Platform-Agnostic Deployment**:
- Single manifest supporting multiple architectures
- Automatic platform selection by container runtime
- Consistent functionality across all supported platforms

### 4. CI/CD Integration Architecture

**Automated Build Pipeline**:
- Triggered on source code changes, Dockerfile modifications, and releases
- Security scanning at both filesystem and container image levels
- Automated testing of container functionality
- Multi-platform builds using Docker Buildx

**Registry Publication**:
- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for open-source distribution
- Semantic versioning and branch-based tagging
- Automated publishing on releases and main branch updates
- Retention policies for artifact management

**Quality Gates**:
- Security vulnerability scanning (filesystem and container)
- Container functionality testing
- Security compliance verification (non-root, distroless)
- Performance benchmarking

### 5. Container Interface Design

**Workdir Convention**: `/workspace`
- Standardized working directory for consistent volume mounting
- User-friendly path structure for ADR directories
- Clear separation of container internals and user data

**Volume Mount Patterns**:
```bash
# Standard ADR analysis
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/tbowman01/photondrift:latest inventory --adr-dir /workspace/docs/adr

# Drift detection with output
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/tbowman01/photondrift:latest diff --adr-dir /workspace/docs/adr --directory /workspace
```

**Configuration and Output**:
- Environment variable support for common settings
- Standardized output formats (JSON, YAML, console)
- Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Enhanced Security Posture**:
   - Distroless base reduces attack surface by ~90%
   - Non-root execution prevents privilege escalation
   - Automated vulnerability scanning catches issues early
   - Supply chain security through attestations and SBOMs

2. **Simplified Distribution**:
   - Single container works across all supported platforms
   - No dependency management for end users
   - Standardized execution environment
   - Easy integration into existing container infrastructures

3. **Improved Developer Experience**:
   - Consistent behavior across development, testing, and production
   - No local Rust toolchain required for usage
   - Fast startup and execution times
   - Clear documentation and usage patterns

4. **CI/CD Ready**:
   - Native integration with container orchestrators
   - Standardized health checking and monitoring
   - Automated builds and security scanning
   - Semantic versioning and release automation

5. **Cloud-Native Compatibility**:
   - Kubernetes deployment ready
   - Docker Compose integration
   - Support for auto-scaling based on workload
   - Container registry integration

### Negative

1. **Additional Complexity**:
   - Container build and maintenance overhead
   - Multi-stage build complexity for developers
   - Container registry management requirements
   - Security scanning and compliance processes

2. **Resource Overhead**:
   - Container runtime requirements
   - Additional disk space for images
   - Build time increase due to multi-stage process
   - Network bandwidth for image distribution

3. **Platform Dependencies**:
   - Requires Docker/container runtime for execution
   - Additional tooling for container management
   - Platform-specific optimization considerations

### Neutral

1. **Migration Path**: Existing binary distribution continues alongside containerization
2. **Learning Curve**: Teams must understand container security and operations
3. **Tooling Integration**: May require workflow updates for container-first approaches

## Implementation Details

### Container Metadata Standards

Following OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards:
- Comprehensive labeling for metadata and discovery
- Version tracking and source code references
- License and vendor information
- Security and compliance indicators

### Registry Strategy

**Primary Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- Integrated with source repository
- Automated builds and publishing
- Public access for open-source distribution
- Built-in security scanning

**Tagging Strategy**:
- `latest`: Latest stable release
- `main`: Latest main branch build  
- `v{version}`: Semantic version tags
- `{branch}-{sha}`: Development builds

### Security Scanning Integration

**Multi-Layer Scanning**:
1. **Filesystem Scanning**: Source code and dependencies
2. **Container Scanning**: Final container image
3. **Runtime Scanning**: Deployed container monitoring
4. **Compliance Scanning**: Security policy adherence

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Automated Security Updates**: Base image updates trigger rebuilds
2. **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Continuous scanning for new vulnerabilities
3. **Performance Metrics**: Container startup time and resource usage tracking
4. **User Feedback**: Container usage patterns and issue reporting

## Future Considerations

1. **Kubernetes Operators**: Custom operators for ADR management in clusters
2. **Edge Computing**: ARM64 optimization for edge deployment scenarios
3. **Serverless Integration**: Container-based serverless function deployment
4. **Multi-Registry**: Additional registry support for enterprise environments
