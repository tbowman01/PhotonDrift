# Icon Creation Instructions

Since VS Code Marketplace requires PNG icons, we need to create a 128x128 PNG icon.

## Recommended approach:
1. Use an image editor to create a 128x128 PNG icon
2. Design should include:
   - Background in PhotonDrift blue (#0066cc)
   - Document/page symbol in white
   - Some indicator of AI/drift detection (waves or dots)
   - Clean, professional appearance

## Alternative:
Use online tools to convert the SVG to PNG at 128x128 pixels.

For now, we'll create a placeholder icon to complete the packaging test.
