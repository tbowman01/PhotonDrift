## 🎯 Key Optimization Strategies Implemented

### Multi-Layer Cargo Caching
```yaml
Layer 1: Registry Cache    (Most stable, 7d TTL)
Layer 2: Git Dependencies  (Moderate, 3d TTL)  
Layer 3: sccache Objects   (High performance, 1d TTL)
Layer 4: Target Directory  (Most volatile, 6h TTL)
```

### Intelligent Fallback Chains
- **Primary Key**: Exact match with full specificity
- **Fallback 1**: Partial match without commit SHA
- **Fallback 2**: Feature-set match without source changes
- **Fallback 3**: Base configuration match
- **Fallback 4**: Platform-level fallback

### Smart Cache Key Strategies
- **Aggressive**: Maximum reuse, fastest builds (PR feedback)
- **Balanced**: Performance vs safety (development)
- **Conservative**: Maximum reliability (feature branches)
- **Stable**: Highest isolation (production releases)

### Advanced Features
- **sccache Integration**: Distributed compilation caching
- **Parallel Warming**: Multiple feature sets compiled simultaneously
- **Platform Isolation**: Separate caches per OS/architecture
- **TypeScript Optimization**: Incremental compilation with tsbuildinfo
- **WASM Multi-target**: Parallel builds for nodejs/web/bundler
- **Docker BuildKit**: Advanced layer caching with registry storage
