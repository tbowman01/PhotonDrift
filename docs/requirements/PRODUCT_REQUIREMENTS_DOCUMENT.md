## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

```gherkin
Feature: Technical Risk Management
  As a risk manager
  I want to identify and mitigate technical risks
  So that project success probability is maximized

  Scenario: ML model accuracy risks
    Given ML models may have accuracy issues
    When models are deployed in production
    Then accuracy should be continuously monitored
    And fallback to rule-based detection should be available
    And model retraining should be automated
    And confidence thresholds should be adjustable

  Scenario: Performance scalability risks
    Given large codebases may strain system resources
    When processing very large projects
    Then graceful degradation should be implemented
    And incremental processing should be available
    And memory usage should be bounded
    And processing should be interruptible and resumable

  Scenario: Dependency management risks
    Given external dependencies may have issues
    When dependencies are updated or become unavailable
    Then critical dependencies should be vendored
    And alternative implementations should be considered
    And security vulnerabilities should be monitored
    And update processes should be automated

  Scenario Outline: Risk mitigation strategies
    Given <risk_category> risks exist
    When implementing mitigation strategies
    Then <primary_mitigation> should be implemented
    And <secondary_mitigation> should be available
    And risk probability should be reduced to <acceptable_level>
    
    Examples:
      | risk_category | primary_mitigation    | secondary_mitigation | acceptable_level |
      | accuracy      | continuous_monitoring | fallback_rules      | <5%              |
      | performance   | incremental_processing| graceful_degradation | <10%             |
      | security      | dependency_scanning   | vendored_deps       | <1%              |
```

### Business Risks

```gherkin
Feature: Business Risk Assessment
  As a business leader
  I want to understand business risks
  So that appropriate risk mitigation strategies can be implemented

  Scenario: Market competition risks
    Given competitors may develop similar solutions
    When market competition increases
    Then unique value propositions should be strengthened
    And time-to-market should be optimized
    And feature differentiation should be maintained
    And customer loyalty should be built

  Scenario: Technology obsolescence risks
    Given underlying technologies may become obsolete
    When technology landscape changes
    Then architecture should be modular and adaptable
    And migration strategies should be planned
    And technology monitoring should be continuous
    And alternative approaches should be researched

  Scenario: Resource availability risks
    Given development resources may become constrained
    When team capacity is limited
    Then critical path activities should be prioritized
    And knowledge should be documented and shared
    And external resources should be identified
    And scope should be adjustable

  Scenario Outline: Business risk mitigation
    Given <business_risk> may impact project success
    When implementing risk controls
    Then mitigation should reduce impact by <impact_reduction>%
    And probability should be reduced by <probability_reduction>%
    And residual risk should be <residual_level>
    
    Examples:
      | business_risk      | impact_reduction | probability_reduction | residual_level |
      | market_competition | 70              | 50                   | low            |
      | tech_obsolescence  | 80              | 60                   | low            |
