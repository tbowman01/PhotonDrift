# Architectural Analysis of PhotonDrift ADRScan Project

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This ADR documents the architectural analysis of the PhotonDrift repository using ADRScan itself (dogfooding). The analysis was performed on branch `testing/dogfood1` to evaluate the current state of the codebase and document architectural decisions that have emerged during development.

### Repository Analysis Results

**Scan Statistics:**
- Files Scanned: 198
- Lines Analyzed: 30,005
- Scan Duration: 39ms
- ADRs Analyzed: 1
- File Types Distribution:
  - Rust (.rs): 25 files (core implementation)
  - Markdown (.md): 118 files (documentation)
  - YAML (.yml/.yaml): 19 files (CI/CD workflows)
  - JSON: 9 files (configuration)
  - Other: 27 files (builds, scripts, assets)

**Drift Detection Results:**
- Total Drift Items: 0
- Architecture compliance: ✅ CLEAN
- No architectural violations detected

## Decision

We document the following architectural decisions that have emerged in the PhotonDrift ADRScan project:

### 1. Multi-Target Architecture

**Decision:** Implement a unified codebase supporting three deployment targets:
- Native CLI binary (primary target)
- WebAssembly module for browser integration
- Library crate for programmatic use

**Rationale:**
- Maximizes code reuse across platforms
- Enables browser-based ADR tools
- Provides flexibility for integration scenarios

### 2. Machine Learning Enhanced Drift Detection

**Decision:** Integrate ML capabilities for advanced architectural drift detection using multiple algorithms:
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- One-Class SVM for pattern recognition  
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for neighborhood-based analysis

**Rationale:**
- Improves drift detection accuracy beyond rule-based approaches
- Learns from historical patterns
- Adapts to project-specific architectural styles

### 3. Modular Component Architecture

**Decision:** Structure the codebase in clearly separated modules:

```
src/
├── commands/        # CLI command implementations
├── config/          # Configuration management
├── drift/           # Core drift detection engine
├── ml/              # Machine learning models
├── parser/          # ADR and content parsing
├── error/           # Error handling
└── wasm.rs          # WebAssembly bindings
```

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Facilitates testing and maintenance
- Supports selective compilation for different targets

### 4. Feature-Gated Dependencies

**Decision:** Use Cargo features to conditionally include dependencies:
- `default = ["tokio"]` - Standard async runtime
- `wasm` - WebAssembly specific dependencies
- `ml` - Machine learning libraries

**Rationale:**
- Reduces binary size for specific use cases
- Enables WASM compilation (no tokio/file system)
- Optional ML features for resource-constrained environments

### 5. Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

**Decision:** Implement multiple workflow types:
- **CI:** Testing, formatting, security audits
- **Release:** Multi-platform binary builds
- **WASM Build:** WebAssembly module publishing
- **ADRScan Action:** Reusable GitHub Action for drift detection
- **Project Automation:** Issue and PR management

**Rationale:**
- Ensures code quality across all targets
- Automates distribution for multiple platforms
- Provides self-hosting capabilities (GitHub Action)

### 6. Snapshot-Based Drift Detection

**Decision:** Use JSON snapshots to track architectural baseline:
- Save current state as `.adrscan-snapshot.json`
- Compare against previous snapshots for drift detection
- Store rich metadata about file types, patterns, and statistics

**Rationale:**
- Enables diff-based analysis
- Tracks evolution over time
- Provides audit trail of architectural changes

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Dogfooding Success**: ADRScan successfully analyzed its own codebase with zero drift detection, indicating good architectural consistency

2. **Scalable Architecture**: The modular design supports growth from simple CLI to comprehensive ADR management platform

3. **Cross-Platform Reach**: WASM support enables web-based ADR tools and browser integration

4. **ML-Enhanced Intelligence**: Advanced algorithms provide superior drift detection beyond traditional rule-based approaches

5. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline ensures reliability and automated delivery

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: Multi-target support increases build complexity and testing requirements

2. **Dependency Management**: Feature gates require careful coordination of optional dependencies

3. **Binary Size**: ML dependencies may increase binary size when enabled

### Neutral

1. **Learning Curve**: ML-enhanced features require understanding of algorithm characteristics

2. **Platform Variations**: Different feature sets available depending on compilation target

## Compliance Notes

This analysis demonstrates ADRScan's capability to:
- Analyze large codebases efficiently (30K+ lines in 39ms)
- Handle diverse file types (8 different file extensions)
- Maintain architectural consistency (0 drift items detected)
- Self-document through dogfooding

## Future Considerations

1. Consider additional ML algorithms as the codebase grows
2. Evaluate performance optimizations for larger repositories
3. Explore integration with IDE plugins and development tools
4. Assess feasibility of real-time drift monitoring
