# ü§ñ GitHub Coordinator Documentation

## Overview

The **GitHub Coordinator** is a comprehensive automation system designed to identify and resolve build issues, manage merge conflicts, and maintain repository health through intelligent workflow orchestration.

## üéØ Objective

**Primary Goal**: Automatically identify and resolve build issues, update merge conflicts, and resubmit PRs until they complete successfully or fail fast with clear error reporting.

## üîß Components

### 1. ü§ñ GitHub Coordinator (`gh-coordinator.yml`)

**Main orchestration workflow that coordinates all automation activities.**

#### Triggers
- Push to `develop`, `main`, or feature branches
- Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened, ready_for_review)
- Manual workflow dispatch with options:
  - `target_branch`: Branch for conflict resolution (default: `develop`)
  - `force_rebuild`: Force rebuild and retry failed builds
  - `auto_fix_conflicts`: Automatically resolve merge conflicts

#### Key Features
- **Pre-flight Analysis**: Analyzes repository state and determines required actions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves merge conflicts using smart strategies
- **Build Validation**: Comprehensive multi-platform and multi-feature testing
- **PR Management**: Automated PR updates and resubmission
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and failure detection
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive status reporting and issue creation

#### Jobs Overview
1. **Pre-flight Analysis**: Repository state analysis and decision making
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Automated merge conflict resolution
3. **Build Validation**: Multi-matrix build testing across platforms and features
4. **PR Management**: Automated fixes and PR resubmission
5. **Monitoring**: Status reporting and alerting
6. **Success Cleanup**: Post-success cleanup and issue closure

### 2. üîß Automated Conflict Resolver (`conflict-resolver.yml`)

**Specialized workflow for resolving branch conflicts with multiple strategies.**

#### Triggers
- Manual workflow dispatch with options:
  - `source_branch`: Branch to merge from
  - `target_branch`: Branch to merge into  
  - `strategy`: Resolution strategy (smart, ours, theirs, manual)
  - `force_merge`: Force merge with conflicts

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies

##### Smart Strategy (Default)
- **Rust source files**: Prefer source branch (newer features)
- **Documentation**: Merge both versions, remove conflict markers
- **Configuration files**: Prefer target branch (stability)
- **Dependencies**: Intelligent merge of Cargo.toml

##### Other Strategies
- **ours**: Keep target branch changes
- **theirs**: Keep source branch changes  
- **manual**: Create PR for manual resolution

#### Features
- **Pre-merge Analysis**: Detect conflicts before attempting resolution
- **Intelligent Resolution**: File-type-aware conflict resolution
- **Manual Fallback**: Create PRs for conflicts requiring human intervention
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed resolution reports

### 3. üìä Continuous Build Monitor (`build-monitor.yml`)

**Proactive monitoring system for build health and performance.**

#### Triggers
- Schedule: Every 30 minutes during business hours (UTC)
- Manual dispatch with options:
  - `monitor_duration`: Monitoring duration in minutes
  - `alert_threshold`: Alert threshold for build failures (%)

#### Features
- **Build Health Metrics**: Success rate, failure rate, average build time
- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Categorizes failures (build, test, lint)
- **Automated Alerting**: Creates issues for critical build health problems
- **Dependency Health**: Monitors dependency issues and security vulnerabilities
- **Auto-Resolution**: Closes alerts when build health improves

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gates & Protection (`quality-gates.yml`)

**Comprehensive quality assurance system with intelligent gating.**

#### Triggers
- Pull request events
- Push to main/develop branches
- Manual dispatch with enforcement options

#### Quality Checks
- **Pre-Check Analysis**: Change scope and risk assessment
- **Code Quality**: Formatting, linting, security audit, complexity analysis
- **Build Matrix**: Multi-platform, multi-feature build validation
- **Dependency Quality**: Duplicate detection, licensing, security

#### Smart Gating
- **Change-Aware**: Adjusts checks based on change scope (docs-only, code, config)
- **Risk-Based**: Applies stricter checks for high-risk changes
- **Draft-Friendly**: Lighter checks for draft PRs

### 5. üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Setup (`setup-branch-protection.yml`)

**Automated branch protection configuration.**

#### Features
- **Configuration-Driven**: Uses `.github/branch-protection.json` for settings
- **Dry Run Support**: Preview changes before applying
- **Multiple Branches**: Configure multiple branches simultaneously
- **Validation**: Check current protection status

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Enable GitHub Coordinator**: The workflows are automatically triggered by repository events
2. **Configure Branch Protection**: Run the setup workflow to configure protection rules
3. **Monitor Build Health**: Automatic monitoring starts immediately

### Manual Operations

#### Resolve Conflicts
```yaml
# Use GitHub Actions UI or CLI
gh workflow run conflict-resolver.yml \
  -f source_branch=main \
  -f target_branch=develop \
  -f strategy=smart
```

#### Force Build Retry
```yaml
gh workflow run gh-coordinator.yml \
  -f force_rebuild=true \
  -f target_branch=develop
```

#### Setup Branch Protection
```yaml
gh workflow run setup-branch-protection.yml \
  -f target_branches="main,develop" \
  -f dry_run=false
```

### Configuration Files

#### `.github/branch-protection.json`
Defines branch protection rules for different branches:

```json
{
  "main": {
    "required_status_checks": {
      "strict": true,
      "contexts": ["Quality Gates", "Build Matrix"]
    },
    "required_pull_request_reviews": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 1,
      "require_code_owner_reviews": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### `.github/CODEOWNERS`
Defines code ownership for automated review requests.

## üîÑ Automation Flow

### Typical PR Flow
1. **PR Created**: Quality gates analyze changes and apply appropriate checks
2. **Build Issues Detected**: GitHub Coordinator automatically attempts fixes
3. **Conflicts Found**: Conflict resolver applies smart resolution strategies
