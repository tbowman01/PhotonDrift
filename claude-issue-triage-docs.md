npx claude-flow@alpha github issue-triage --repository owner/repo --auto-label --filter "needs-triage"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"        # Required: GitHub API access
export AUTO_LABEL="true"                       # Optional: Auto-apply labels
export AUTO_ASSIGN="true"                      # Optional: Auto-assign issues  
export CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD="0.7"              # Optional: Minimum confidence (0.0-1.0)

```

### GitHub Actions Integration

The triage system automatically runs on:
- **Issue Events**: opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled
- **Manual Trigger**: workflow_dispatch with custom parameters
- **Scheduled**: Weekly bulk triage (optional)

## Classification Types

### 🐛 Bug Issues
- **Patterns**: `[BUG]`, error messages, crash reports, broken functionality
- **Auto-Labels**: `bug`, priority based on severity
- **Assignment**: `rust-team`, `core-developers`
- **Escalation**: Critical bugs → `leads-team`

### 🔒 Security Issues  
- **Patterns**: CVE references, vulnerability reports, security concerns
- **Auto-Labels**: `security`, `priority-critical`
- **Assignment**: `security-team`, `architecture-lead`
- **Escalation**: Immediate notification to security team

### 📊 Performance Issues
- **Patterns**: Slow performance, memory leaks, optimization requests  
- **Auto-Labels**: `performance`, `priority-medium`
- **Assignment**: `performance-team`, `optimization-experts`
- **Escalation**: Production impact → higher priority

### 📦 Dependency Issues
- **Patterns**: Package updates, version conflicts, Renovate PRs
- **Auto-Labels**: `dependencies`, priority based on security impact
- **Assignment**: `maintenance-team`, `rust-team`  
- **Escalation**: Security advisories → `priority-high`

### ✨ Feature Requests
- **Patterns**: `[PHASE X]`, new functionality, enhancements
- **Auto-Labels**: `type-feature`, component labels
- **Assignment**: Based on component (WASM → `wasm-specialist`)
- **Escalation**: Phase 3 features → `priority-high`

### 📝 Documentation
- **Patterns**: Documentation requests, guides, analysis reports
- **Auto-Labels**: `documentation`, `priority-low`
- **Assignment**: `docs-team`, `technical-writers`
- **Escalation**: User-facing docs → higher priority

### 🔄 CI/CD Issues
- **Patterns**: Pipeline failures, workflow issues, automation
- **Auto-Labels**: `ci-cd`, component labels
- **Assignment**: `devops-team`, `automation-engineers`
- **Escalation**: Blocking deployments → `priority-high`

## Priority Scoring System

### 🔴 Critical Priority (Score ≥ 0.8)
- Security vulnerabilities with active exploits
- Production-breaking bugs with no workaround
- Emergency fixes blocking development
- **SLA**: Response within 2 hours

### 🟠 High Priority (Score ≥ 0.6)  
- Phase 3 features (WASM, GitHub Actions)
- Severe bugs affecting core functionality
- Security issues without active exploits
- **SLA**: Response within 24 hours

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Score ≥ 0.3)
- Performance improvements
- Standard feature requests  
- Non-blocking bugs with workarounds
- **SLA**: Response within 3 days

### 🟢 Low Priority (Score < 0.3)
- Documentation updates
- Future roadmap items
- Minor enhancements
- **SLA**: Response within 1 week

## Team Assignment Logic

### Expertise-Based Matching
- **WASM Issues** → `wasm-specialist` + `rust-team`
- **Core Engine** → `core-developers` + `rust-team`  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** → `devops-team` + `automation-engineers`
- **Security** → `security-team` + `architecture-lead`
- **Performance** → `performance-team` + `optimization-experts`

### Workload Balancing
- Track assignment history and current workload
- Rotate assignments within teams for skill development
- Escalate to team leads for critical issues
- Consider time zones and availability

### Fallback Assignment
- Unknown types → `triage-team`
- High confidence but no team match → `leads-team`
- System errors → `maintainers`

## Confidence Scoring

### Pattern Recognition (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Title Patterns**: 40% weight - Direct keyword matches
- **Body Patterns**: 30% weight - Content analysis  
- **Indicators**: 20% weight - Special markers (templates, etc.)
- **Context**: 10% weight - Labels, assignees, project context

### Multi-Factor Analysis
- **Keyword Density**: Frequency of relevant terms
- **Template Usage**: Proper issue template completion
- **Historical Patterns**: Learning from previous classifications
- **Cross-Reference**: Links to related issues/PRs

### Confidence Thresholds
- **0.9+**: Extremely confident - Auto-apply all actions
- **0.7-0.9**: High confidence - Default auto-labeling threshold
- **0.5-0.7**: Medium confidence - Apply with human review flag
- **0.3-0.5**: Low confidence - Manual review required  
- **<0.3**: Very low confidence - Add to triage queue

## Learning and Adaptation

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Track maintainer corrections to classifications
- **Pattern Evolution**: Update patterns based on new issue types
- **Team Feedback**: Incorporate assignment accuracy metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and resolution rates

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Classification Models**: Train on historical issue data
- **Similarity Matching**: Find related issues for context
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging issue patterns
- **Predictive Assignment**: Suggest optimal team members

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Real-Time Dashboard
- **Classification Accuracy**: % of correctly classified issues
- **Response Time**: Average time to first maintainer response  
- **Resolution Rate**: Issues closed vs. created over time
- **Team Workload**: Current assignments per team member

### Weekly Reports
- **Volume Analysis**: Issue creation trends by type
- **Priority Distribution**: Critical vs. routine issue balance
- **Team Performance**: Assignment accuracy and response times
- **System Health**: Classification confidence trends

### Quality Assurance
- **Human Validation**: Random sampling of auto-classifications
- **Error Analysis**: Review and learn from misclassifications  
- **Feedback Integration**: Maintainer corrections improve models
- **Threshold Optimization**: Adjust confidence levels based on accuracy

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversal of incorrect classifications

### Access Control
- **Token Permissions**: Minimal required GitHub API scopes
- **Team Restrictions**: Assignment limited to authorized teams
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear chain of responsibility
- **Manual Override**: Maintainers can always override automation

### 🔄 Usage Options

**Command Line** (via intelligent-triage.js):
```bash
# Analysis only
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx node scripts/intelligent-triage.js

# Auto-apply labels
AUTO_LABEL=true GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx node scripts/intelligent-triage.js  

# Full automation with assignment
AUTO_LABEL=true AUTO_ASSIGN=true GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx node scripts/intelligent-triage.js
```

**GitHub Actions** (automatic):

- Integrates with existing workflows

**Claude Flow Command**:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha github issue-triage --repository tbowman01/PhotonDrift --auto-label
```

### 🎯 Current State Integration

The system enhances your existing setup:
- **Respects current labels**: Works with phase-*, priority-*, component-* structure
- **Maintains workflows**: Enhances rather than replaces current automation
- **Team assignments**: Maps to existing team structure (rust-team, devops-team, etc.)
- **Preserves manual control**: Maintainers can override any automated decision

### 📈 Expected Improvements

Based on the analysis of your current issues:
- **Faster triage**: Immediate classification vs. manual review
- **Consistent labeling**: Reduces human error in categorization  
- **Better assignment**: Expertise-based routing vs. generic assignment
- **Security alerting**: Automatic escalation of security issues
- **Priority alignment**: Phase 3 features automatically marked high priority

The system is now ready for deployment and will help streamline your GitHub issue management process while maintaining the quality and control you need for the PhotonDrift project.
