## 🎯 Critical Findings & Recommendations

### 🔥 Priority 1: WASM Build Compatibility
**Issue:** WASM builds fail due to mio/tokio networking incompatibility
**Impact:** High - WASM feature cannot be built/deployed
**Solution:**
```toml
# In Cargo.toml - Conditional tokio features for WASM
[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }

[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", default-features = false, features = ["macros", "rt"] }
```

### ⚡ Priority 2: Build Performance Optimization (COMPLETED)
**Issue:** Container build times were slow - NOW RESOLVED
**Improvements Implemented:**
1. **Layer Caching:** ✅ Implemented advanced build cache strategies
2. **Parallel Builds:** ✅ Optimized CARGO_BUILD_JOBS and parallel execution
3. **Profile Optimization:** ✅ New dev/dev-opt/production build profiles
4. **Script Automation:** ✅ Fast development build script created

### 🔐 Priority 3: Security Enhancements
**Recommendations:**
1. **Rootless Builds:** Consider rootless Docker builds
2. **SBOM Generation:** Enable Software Bill of Materials
3. **Provenance:** Implement build provenance attestations
